        <p> I'm a freshman in standing currently majoring in Theatre and Cognitive Science with a prospective certification in human-computer interaction at Northwestern University. I am interested in developing the intersection between creativity and stem. At this intersection, I believe that I am able to foster process-oriented art that is focused on social impact and liberation. I have taken courses that focus on creating theater in modern society, as well as using logic and critical thinking skills to identify and solve problems. Additionally, I've worked in positions that focus on social impact, as well as volunteering for community spaces that foster situations children can explore, learn and thrive. </p>
